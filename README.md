Extended Cambridge Model â€“ Continuous Simulation

Key Features / Code Modifications
Activity Settings Enhancement
Enabled recording of activity inputs (e.g. running, cycling) in continuous simulations
Adjusted input processing for multi-day activity sequences
Visualization Updates
Added running and cycling markers to output plots
New Metric Calculation
Automated calculation of Time in Range (TIR) for blood glucose


Run the 14-day simulation with:
python manual_script.py --settings_file pymgipsim/Settings/DefaultSettings/scenario_continuous100.json

       Distributors: you can replace the contents of this file with your own custom

       For example, this is a good place to put any checks for hardware requirements
       or BLAS/LAPACK library initialization.
       
       The SciPy standard source distribution will not put code in this file beyond
       the try-except import of `_distributor_init_local` (which is not part of a
       standard source distribution), so you can safely replace this file with your
       own version.
